## Overview

`powERP` is a production-style internal platform for a consignment business operating physical display cases inside third-party stores.

It replaces manual coordination with a structured system for:

- route planning and daily field execution
- inventory counting and inferred sales
- payment registration and discrepancy handling
- replenishment from central stock to field staff to display cases
- admin visibility into visits, stock, guarantees, purchasing, and analytics

This is one of my strongest portfolio projects because it combines product thinking, operational domain modeling, backend integrity, and end-to-end ownership.

## Highlights

- Mobile-first workflow for field collaborators
- Role-based admin and field experiences
- SQL triggers and RPCs for transactional inventory logic
- Offline-first field execution with sync queue and image compression
- Dashboard and exportable reports for operational analytics
- Server-side Excel export flow backed by `exceljs`
- Automated coverage with Playwright, Vitest, and CI checks

## Current Scope

Implemented in the current release candidate through Fase 2:

- auth and role-based routing
- products, categories, users, routes, and points of sale
- display cases and central inventory
- route-of-the-day and visit execution
- counting, payment capture, replenishment, guarantees, incidences, photos, and transactional visit closing
- supplier and purchase management with reception flow
- dashboard with monthly collections, low-stock visibility, and open-incidence feed
- exportable reports for sales, ranking, inventory, visits, and incidences/guarantees

Release hardening included:

- coherent role home routing, including `compras`
- at least one final display-case photo required to complete a visit
- local Supabase reset + auth seeding + type generation workflow
- CI pipeline and release checklist for commercial readiness
